# CodeClauseInternship_AgeGenderPrediction
An image analysis project employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict both age and gender from images of people of different ages.

## Overview
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict both the age and gender of individuals from images. By harnessing deep learning techniques, we aim to create an accurate and efficient model for age and gender estimation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fardeenk/age-gender-dataset)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

``` git clone https://github.com/vinpatrol/CodeClauseInternship_AgeGenderPrediction.git ```

2. Install the required dependencies
```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
```

## Result
1. The age prediction model achieves a R2 score of 0.797
2. The gender prediction model achieves a accuracy of 0.90 on the test set

## Acknowlegments
I have used Kaggle Notebook for this project, which provided access to T4 GPU for performing the CNN model building steps.
